    "## Theory in a nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will try to keep the theory to a minimum and quickly expose you to practical examples. However, we want to make sure that some of the basic underlying concepts are clear to everyone and define a common mathematical notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of PyLops lies the concept of **linear operators**. A linear operator is generally a mapping or function that acts linearly on elements of a space to produce elements of another space. More specifically we say that $\\mathbf{A}:\\mathbb{F}^m \\to \\mathbb{F}^n$ is a linear operator that maps a vector of size $m$ in the *model space* to a vector of size $n$ in the *data space*:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/forward.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We will refer to this as **forward model (or operation)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely the application of its adjoint to a data vector is referred to as **adjoint modelling (or operation)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/adjoint.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, a linear operator can be seen as a **matrix** of size $n \\times m$ (and the adjoint is simply its transpose and complex conjugate). However in a more general sense we can think of a linear operator as any pair of software code that mimics the effect a matrix on a model vector as well as that of its adjoint to a data vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving an inverse problems accounts to removing the effect of the operator/matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ from the data $\\mathbf{y}$ to retrieve the model $\\mathbf{x}$ (or an approximation of it).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the inverse of $\\mathbf{A}$ is generally not explicitely required. A solution can be obtained using either direct methods, matrix decompositions (eg SVD) or iterative solvers. Luckily, many iterative methods (e.g. cg, lsqr) do not need to know the individual entries of a matrix to solve a linear system. Such solvers only require the computation of forward and adjoint matrix-vector products - exactly what a linear operator does!\n",
    "\n",
    "**So what?**\n",
    "We have learned that to solve an inverse problem, we do not need to express the modelling operator in terms of its dense (or sparse) matrix. All we need to know is how to perform the forward and adjoint operations - ideally as fast as possible and using the least amount of memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first task will be to understand how we can effectively write a linear operator on pen and paper and translate it into computer code. We will consider 2 examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Element-wise multiplication (also known as Hadamard product)\n",
    "- First Derivative"
