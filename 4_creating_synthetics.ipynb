    "# Creating seismic synthetics with Devito and GemPy\n",
    "In this tutorial, we aim to provide a start-to-finish guide for creating synthetic seismic models and datasets using the open-source packages Devito and GemPy. We will highlight the steps involved, from creating a 3D geological model, to forward modelling, to visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "* Introduce users to creating simple geological models with GemPy\n",
    "* Illustrate how to include physical properties in the geological model and how to convert this into a format usable for seismic modelling with Devito\n",
    "* Set up a Devito `operator` to solve the 2nd order acoustic wave equation, including sparse sources and receivers\n",
    "* Forward propagate a shot through the model, and record a synthetic gather using receivers\n",
    "* Visualise the wavefield in 3D using slicing in PyVista\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "This tutorial will be presented in three sections. The first section will focus on creating the seismic synthetic, the second on model setup and the Devito API, and the latter will cover running the seismic wave model and visualising the wavefield.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the tutorial, several members of the team will be available in the `#t21-thurs-devito` channel of the [Software Underground Slack](https://softwareunderground.org/slack). For in-depth GemPy questions, the `#gempy` channel is another option. For Devito-centric questions, try the `#devito` channel or the [Devito Slack](https://devitocodes.slack.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Synthetic seismic models are crucial for testing and benchmarking numerous seismic modelling and imaging applications. Whilst several seismic synthetics  are commonplace within the community for example the ubiquitous Marmousi model, or the SEG/EAGE Salt and Overthrust Models, the range of freely-available synthetics is relatively small, with other purpose-built models carrying a steep cost. Furthermore currently-available seismic synthetics may not bear sufficient resemblence to the desired target, or may be lacking certain material properties required for a particular wave equation. This has implications for both accessibility and reproducibility of studies, as benchmarks used may not be readily available for others to verify the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using freely-available tools to create synthetic models and datasets, we can create open, sharable, customisable models for a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Side Note (Google Colab only)\n",

    "If running on Google Colab, you will need to run the following cells to prevent 3D renders crashing your notebook."

    "The simple geological model which we will be building is designed to evoke carbon-capture and storage (CCS) scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model consists of a CO2 lens in a sandstone reservoir, with a shale layer in the overarching anticline providing the structural trap. This is then overlain by a layer of sediment, with water at the top of the model. Geological strata and their respective velocities are based on values detailed in [Queißer et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1190/geo2012-0216.1), a paper imaging the P-wave velocity anomaly generated by CO2 injection into the Utsira Sand at Sleipnir in the North Sea using FWI. The model we will create features a similar shale trap/permeable sandstone reservoir structure, albeit with a small number of thick layers rather than the thin interbedding, to limit model complexity for this tutorial. Further inspiration was taken from [Chadwick et al. 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2004.03.071), a paper characterizing the Utsira Sand reservoir based on 2D seismic lines and well logs.\n",

    "The last piece of the puzzle is the computational limitation. In the field, the seismic wave propagates in every direction to an \"infinite\" distance. However, solving the wave equation in a mathematically/discrete infinite domain is not feasible. In order to compensate, Absorbing Boundary Conditions (ABC) or Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) are required to mimic an infinite domain. These two methods allow to approximate an infinite media by damping and absorbing the waves at the limit of the domain to avoid reflections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest of these methods is the absorbing boundary region. The core idea is to extend the physical domain and to add an absorbing region in this extension that will absorb the incident waves. The acoustic wave equation with this damping region can be rewritten as:\n",

    " &m \\frac{\\partial^2 u(\\textbf{x},t)}{\\partial t^2} - \\nabla^2 u(\\textbf{x},t) + \\eta \\frac{\\partial u(\\textbf{x},t)}{\\partial t}=q  \\ \\text{in } \\Omega \\\\\n",

    " &\\frac{\\partial u(\\textbf{x},t)}{\\partial t}|_{t=0} = 0 \n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is the damping coefficient equal to $0$ inside the physical domain and increasing inside the absorbing region. Multiple choices of profile can be chosen for $\\eta$ from linear to exponential.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the physical problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to define the physical model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the physical dimensions of interest?\n",
    "* What is the velocity profile of this physical domain?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the velocity velocity model which we have just created using GemPy. As such we need to create a physical domain of the same size. As mentioned earlier, Devito and GemPy have slightly different grid implementations, which we will need to bear in mind to ensure our Devito model maps correctly to the GemPy grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now construct a Devito `Model`. This is a convenience object encapsulating the necessary parameters and components of an acoustic wave model, including additional damping layers around the perimeter (specified by `bcs=\"damp\"`). For implementing custom damping setups, see `examples/userapi/04_boundary_conditions.ipynb` in the Devito repository. Note that we are using a relatively large number of damping layers here. This is to avoid our gathers becoming too messy, and ensure that reflections from horizons can be straightforwardly identified in the gathers. These damping layers are added to the edge of the specified model, increasing its extent (this is important for later visualisation)."

In combination, we can use these to build new resources for the geoscience community, and ensure that they are adaptable and widely available. Devito is used commercially, and has been deployed at scale, allowing straightforward scaling between small examples and production-scale codes.\n",

We envision generating synthetics for machine learning as one potential application, but are excited to see what applications the community will build from this tutorial.\n",
