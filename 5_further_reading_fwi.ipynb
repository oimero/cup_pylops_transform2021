    "This notebook is an adaption of `examples/seismic/tutorials/03_fwi.ipynb`. In this example we aim to highlight how GemPy-generated models can be used in more involved applications, and the core ideas behind seismic inversion, where we create an image of the subsurface from field recorded data. This tutorial will use the model created in the main tutorial, and will reuse many of the concepts.\n",

    "- **Field data** - or also called **recorded data**. This is a shot record corresponding to the true velocity model. In practice this data is acquired as described in the first tutorial. In order to simplify this tutorial we will fake field data by modelling it with the true velocity model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial velocity model**. This is a velocity model that has been obtained by processing the field data. This model is a rough and very smooth estimate of the velocity as an initial estimate for the inversion. This is a necessary requirement for any optimization (method).\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will introduce the gradient operator. This operator corresponds to the imaging condition introduced in the previous tutorial with some minor modifications that are defined by the objective function (also referred to in the tutorial series as the _functional_, _f_) and its gradient, _g_. We will define these two terms in the tutorial too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes on the operators\n",
